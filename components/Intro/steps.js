        colors: <Highlight color={RAINBOW_COLORS[5]}>purple</Highlight>,{" "}

        <Highlight color={RAINBOW_COLORS[3]}>green</Highlight>,

        <Highlight color={RAINBOW_COLORS[1]}>orange</Highlight> and
        <Highlight color={RAINBOW_COLORS[0]}>red</Highlight>. Every segment has
        the same width and height. We match these to the categories that{" "}

        category. This looks at how LGBTQ+ asylum seekers are treated in each

        Below, you will find the flags for 49 European countries with sizes
        proportional to the coverage of rights for their LGBTQ+ communites. This
        work uses the data gathered yearly by ILGA Europe in their Rainbow
        Index. Our goal is to showcase the huge disparaties between different
        countries but also to make clear that in no country full equality as
