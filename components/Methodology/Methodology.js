          . Because data is not currently made available in a manageable format,
          we scraped it from the website for the years between 2015 to 2022. All
          the raw data and the scrapper code is made available in the
          project&apos;s repository.

          We collected the rating that ILGA provides for each category for each
          country over the years. We also gathered the assessment that the
          organization does of the different criteria inside each category. The
          first set of information is used in the construction of the different
          flags, where the size is proportional to how accomplished the
          countries are in the promotion of equality for their LGBTQ+ community.
          In 2022, Rainbow Data introduced &quot;Intersex bodily integrity&quot;
          as a seventh category. Criteria covered in this category was
          previously part of &quot;Legal gender recognition and bodily
          integrity&quot;. To allow comparison across different years, we merged
          the new category with &quot;Legal gender recognition&quot; for the
          year 2022. To do so, we calculated the weighted average of the two
          categories based on the number of criteria covered by each.
